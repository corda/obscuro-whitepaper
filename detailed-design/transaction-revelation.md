## Privacy Revelation
There are several options for revealing private data to allow law enforcement agencies to prosecute illegal behaviour and deter criminals from taking advantage of Obscuro's privacy features:
* Not make a provision to reveal on the basis that Obscuro is a platform and is unopinionated on what it is used for.
* The transaction encryption key can be rotated and revealed periodically with a delay, such that any interested party can view all transactions.
* A governance committee can approve some data mining enclaves that will have access to the shared secret and output suspicious activity.
* Interested authorities can submit requests for data revelation and after review they may get access to encryption keys for various accounts or for the entire ledger.

From the outset Obscuro will rotate the encryption key every year and reveal historic keys in the first phase, and decide later if additional mechanisms are required. Making no attempt to deter illegal behaviour is unethical. A case-by-case revelation based on authority demands is time-consuming and prone to political interference. It is also difficult to determine objectively what is a bona-fide authority which introduces an ethical dilemma.
